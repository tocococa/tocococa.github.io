        <h1>Knog Blinder E 900 review</h1> 
        <p>
            A few months ago I bought a Knog Blinder E 900 to use as a headlight for my converted ebike.
            felt the light I had <a href="./lighting.html">originally installed</a> was inadequate.
            Although there are some for the battery version, there are little to no reviews of this light online, so I hope this short review helps someone else.
        </p>

        <p>
            It comes with just the necessary accessories to mount it on the handlebars. From the light itself, there's a 
            short lead cable ending in a barrel quick disconnect connector.
        </p>

        <p>
            There is also a cable with a matching connector and a pair of unterminated leads on the other side, to connect it to a battery or power lead.
            You will need to buy a connector and do a little bit of soldering to connect it to your ebike. I already had an APM Superseal 1.5 style connector 
            for the previous light, so I soldered the unterminated leads to a matching connector.

            Once installed, you can tilt the light's arm up or down, and then rotate the light itself by loosening the screw that holds it into the arm.
            This allows you to adjust the light's angle and to clear space for the cable coming out the back.

        </div>
        <p>
            The button on top of the light is used to turn it on and off, and to cycle through the different operating modes.
            A long press turns it on, which by default is a solid bright beam. A single press will
            lower the brightness. A medium press will switch to the different flash modes, there's a
            solid beam with an intermittent bright flash, a slow flash and a fast flash. A long
            press will turn it off.
        </p>
        <p>
            The light does remember the last mode you used and if it was powered on, so 
            if you cut power with a switch, it will turn on in the same mode when you turn it back on,
            which is something I did not know when I bought it and is a really nice feature. The 
            same happens if you turn it off with the button, it will turn on in the last mode when you turn it back on.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, the working beam is very bright, has a nice neutral white color temperature, which is even warmer than
            most car LED headlights and very pleasant, and I do not perceive any flickering.
            I do feel that since it is not a StVZO compliant light, it does not have a beam cutoff,
            so it might be a bit blinding for oncoming traffic, but on the upside, it illuminates
            better to the front and sides of the bike when taking a turn or slowly climbing on an S pattern.

        </div>
        <p>
            After commuting for a few months with it, I'd say it is a good light, as it is very bright, 
            has a good beam pattern, and the build quality is very good.
        </p>
        <p>
            I do want to note that while I have not measured the power consumption, the
            light is plugged to a 12V lead with a 1 A fuse, and it does get slightly warm
            on high beam mode but does not do so in low beam mode, so it cannot be consuming 
            more than 12 W.
        </p>
